sky-plus-hd
===========

Node.js module for controlling and monitoring Sky+ HD set top boxes

**Sorry for lack of documentation. Work in progress!**

**This works for me as of April 2014, I presume I have the latest EPG software - haven't checked.**

Check out the v1-dev branch.

For simpler control (just sending remote control commands) see https://github.com/dalhundal/sky-remote
